    "# I. Python Overview\n",
    "This is a quick introduction to Python. There are lots of other places to learn the language more thoroughly. I have collected a list of useful links, including ones to other learning resources, at the end of this notebook. If you want a little more depth, [Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) is a great place to start, as is Zed Shaw's [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).\n",

    "The lessons that follow make use of the IPython notebooks. There's a good introduction to notebooks [in the IPython notebook documentation](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) that even has a [nice video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6dLGQw9yFQ#!) on how to use the notebooks. You should probably also flip through the [IPython tutorial](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html) in your copious free time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, notebooks have code cells (that are generally followed by result cells) and text cells. The text cells are the stuff that you're reading now. The code cells start with \"In []:\" with some number generally in the brackets. If you put your cursor in the code cell and hit Shift-Enter, the code will run in the Python interpreter and the result will print out in the output cell. You can then change things around and see whether you understand what's going on. If you need to know more, see the [IPython notebook documentation](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) or the [IPython tutorial](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html)."

    "## Functional programming\n",
    "Functional programming is a very broad subject. The idea is to have a series of functions, each of which generates a new data structure from an input, without changing the input structure at all. By not modifying the input structure (something that is called not having *side effects*), many guarantees can be made about how independent the processes are, which can help parallelization and guarantees of program accuracy. There is a [Python Functional Programming HOWTO](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/functional.html) in the standard docs that goes into more details on functional programming. I just wanted to touch on a few of the most important ideas here.\n",

If you want speed with as little effort as possible, write your code in an easy to program language like Python, but dump the slow parts into a faster language like C, and call it from Python.

    "## Other Ways to Speed Python\n",
    "When we compared the fact and factorial functions, above, we noted that C routines are often faster because they're more streamlined. Once we've determined that one routine is a bottleneck for the performance of a program, we can replace it with a faster version by writing it in C. This is called *extending* Python, and there's a [good section in the standard documents](http://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html). This can be a tedious process if you have many different routines to convert. Fortunately, there are several other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Swig](http://swig.org/) (the simplified wrapper and interface generator) is a method to generate binding not only for Python but also for Matlab, Perl, Ruby, and other scripting languages. Swig can scan the header files of a C project and generate Python binding for it. Using Swig is substantially easier than writing the routines in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cython](http://www.cython.org/) is a C-extension language. You can start by compiling a Python routine into a shared object libraries that can be imported into faster versions of the routines. You can then add additional static typing and make other restrictions to further speed the code. Cython is generally easier than using Swig.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyPy](http://pypy.org/) is the easiest way of obtaining fast code. PyPy compiles Python to a subset of the Python language called RPython that can be efficiently compiled and optimized. Over a wide range of tests, PyPy is [roughly 6 times faster than the standard Python Distribution](http://speed.pypy.org/)."
